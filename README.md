This project was created as an example of using Storybook.js to simplify component development. 

Using Storybook Stories, you can build your components "from the inside out", instead of the standard approach. What this means is that you can create individual components without being required to build all the containing components, and still test that they behave the way you expect them to behave. Storybook gives you a canvas to render your components on, and a means to see what actions that a component takes.
